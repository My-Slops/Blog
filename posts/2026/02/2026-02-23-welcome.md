## TL;DR
This blog is a daily writing log optimized for clear reading by both humans and language models.

## Context
I wanted a simple, durable writing setup that is easy to publish and easy to parse.

## Key Points
- Markdown is the source of truth.
- Predictable structure improves retrieval quality.
- Companion machine files (`llms.txt`, `index.json`, `rss.xml`, `sitemap.xml`) help discovery.

## Steps / Code
- Created repository and base structure.
- Added templates and automated index generation.

## Trade-offs
- Static generation is simple but less dynamic.
- Strict structure reduces creative freedom slightly.

## Final Take
Consistency is more important than sophistication. Daily shipping wins.

## Changelog
- 2026-02-23: Initial publish.
