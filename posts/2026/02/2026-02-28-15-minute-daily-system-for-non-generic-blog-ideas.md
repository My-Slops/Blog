## TL;DR

If your ideas feel generic, the problem is usually your input—not your writing skill.

Use this 15-minute pipeline each day: capture raw signals, score them with a simple rubric (usefulness, novelty, durability, specificity), then force each candidate through one practical “reader decision” question. You’ll end up with one focused post idea that is easier to write and more useful to readers.

## Context

Most daily writers don’t run out of words. They run out of sharp angles.

When you open a blank page and ask, “What should I write?”, your brain tends to default to broad topics:
- “AI productivity tips”
- “content strategy in 2026”
- “how to be consistent”

These are fine as categories, but weak as posts. A strong post needs a specific problem, audience, and decision.

The fix is to stop “ideating” in the abstract and instead run a tiny daily extraction system.

## Key Points

### 1) Start with signals, not topics

For 5 minutes, collect 5–10 raw signals from the day:
- a repeated question someone asked,
- a task that took longer than expected,
- a mistake you made,
- a tool behavior that surprised you,
- a claim you read and disagreed with.

Raw signals are messy but real. Real beats clever.

### 2) Score candidates with a 4-factor filter

Give each signal a 1–5 score on:
- **Usefulness:** will this help someone do something better?
- **Novelty:** is the angle non-obvious?
- **Durability:** will this still matter in 6+ months?
- **Specificity:** can I explain this with one concrete example?

Keep only the top 2 by total score.

### 3) Convert each top signal into a reader decision

Force this sentence:

> “After reading this, the reader should be able to decide **X instead of Y**.”

If you cannot complete that sentence, the idea is still too vague.

### 4) Attach one lived example before drafting

Before writing the post, note one concrete example:
- what happened,
- what you tried,
- what changed,
- what failed.

This prevents the draft from becoming generic advice.

### 5) Pick one post and explicitly kill the rest

Choose one winner and park the others in backlog.

Daily output collapses when you keep renegotiating the topic mid-draft. Commit once, then write.

## Steps / Code

### The 15-minute idea pipeline

```text
Minute 0–5   Capture 5–10 raw signals from your day
Minute 5–9   Score each signal (U + N + D + S)
Minute 9–12  Convert top 2 into a "decide X vs Y" outcome
Minute 12–15 Pick one winner + write working title + first 3 bullets
```

### Copy/paste scoring sheet

```md
## Daily Idea Scoring

Date:

1) Idea:
- Usefulness (1-5):
- Novelty (1-5):
- Durability (1-5):
- Specificity (1-5):
- Total:
- Reader decision (X vs Y):
- Example I will include:

2) Idea:
...

Winner:
Why this one:
```

### Example transformation

- **Weak topic:** “How to use AI for writing”
- **Better post idea:** “Why AI-assisted drafts feel polished but low-signal—and a 5-step edit pass to fix them”
- **Reader decision:** “Should I publish this fluent draft now, or spend 20 more minutes to add specificity?”

## Trade-offs

This system is intentionally constrained.

**Costs**
- You may ignore interesting but low-scoring ideas.
- Daily scoring can feel mechanical at first.
- The process adds overhead before drafting.

**Benefits**
- Less time lost staring at blank pages.
- Fewer generic posts.
- Higher consistency because selection becomes procedural.
- Better long-term quality because ideas are grounded in real work.

## Final Take

You do not need better inspiration. You need a better selection system.

A short daily pipeline turns idea generation from mood-driven to process-driven. Once you consistently choose specific, decision-oriented topics, the writing itself becomes much easier—and much more useful.
