## TL;DR
Daily publishing becomes sustainable when you stop waiting for perfect inspiration and start using a fixed system. Pick one idea, time-box research, write in a repeatable structure, and ship only after a quality gate. If no idea appears, start with an ordinary moment (a meal, a movie, a conversation) and extract one useful lesson — momentum will create better ideas.

## Context
Most daily writing streaks fail for operational reasons, not talent reasons:
1. Topic selection starts too late.
2. Research expands without a boundary.
3. There is no binary definition of “done.”

This turns each day into a fresh negotiation with yourself. The solution is to reduce decisions and increase constraints.

## Key Points
### 1) One post = one core argument
A daily post should make one clear claim and support it with evidence, examples, or reasoning.

If you discover two strong claims in one draft, split them into two posts. Focus beats breadth in a daily cadence.

### 2) Score ideas quickly before committing
Use a 4-factor score (1–5 each):
- **Usefulness**: Will this help someone think or do better today?
- **Novelty**: Is there at least one non-obvious angle?
- **Durability**: Will this still matter in 6–12 months?
- **Specificity**: Can this be explained with concrete examples?

Pick the top scorer and commit. Switching topics mid-session is one of the most expensive habits in daily writing.

### 3) Time-box research so writing still happens
Research is to improve truth and usefulness, not to delay drafting.

A reliable default:
- 10–20 min: context scan
- 20–40 min: source collection + claim checks
- 30–60 min: drafting
- 10 min: quality pass

You can shrink each block on busy days, but don’t remove the publish step.

### 4) Use a strict ship gate
Before publishing, verify:
- Is the core idea clear in one sentence?
- Does the TL;DR match the actual conclusion?
- Is there at least one non-obvious insight?
- Are factual claims sourced (or clearly marked as opinion)?
- Are references valid and useful?
- Is the final takeaway actionable?

If a critical check fails, fix it before shipping.

### 5) Fallback modes prevent missed days
You don’t need a masterpiece every day; you need a useful post every day.

If no idea comes to mind, start with something ordinary:
- what you ate,
- what movie you watched,
- or a conversation that stuck with you.

Then ask: *What did this teach me that could help someone else?*

That simple move turns “I have nothing to write” into a concrete starting point. Once you begin, better ideas usually emerge.

## Steps / Code
### The 60-minute daily shipping playbook
```text
00:00–05:00  Choose topic with 4-factor score
05:00–20:00  Gather 2–4 credible references/examples
20:00–45:00  Draft using fixed structure
45:00–55:00  Tighten title, TL;DR, transitions
55:00–60:00  Run ship gate and publish
```

### Quick fallback example (when your mind feels blank)
```text
Prompt: "No idea today."
Start: "I watched a movie last night. Why did one scene stay with me?"
Extract lesson: "The strongest ideas are memorable because they create contrast."
Reader value: "Use contrast in your writing: before/after, wrong/right, naive/experienced."
Ship: short working note with one example + one takeaway.
```

## Trade-offs
- **Pro:** Lower decision fatigue and more consistent output.
- **Con:** Some posts will be narrower than “ultimate guides.”
- **Pro:** Faster learning through daily synthesis.
- **Con:** Less room for perfectionism and exhaustive depth.

The real trade is simple: steady compounding vs occasional brilliance.

## Final Take
Consistency is not a motivation problem; it is a systems design problem. Install a daily loop, use a hard quality gate, and keep fallback formats for low-energy days. When inspiration is missing, start with ordinary life — useful ideas often appear after the first paragraph, not before it.

## Changelog
- 2026-02-24: Initial draft created.
- 2026-02-25: Expanded into full publish-ready version; added concrete fallback example for “no idea” days.
